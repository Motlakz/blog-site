## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size - desktop, tablet, and mobile alike.
- Scroll through the page and view all the design images plastered across the site.
- Watch the heart icon change to red around the edges on click.

### My Process

I watched a tutorial from Geek Probin on how to create a responsive blog site and used some of the layout for inspiration. I applied my own CSS Flexbox concepts to the navbar and header image, followed by CSS Grid to position the art design images across mobile and desktop. These were then followed by some simple DOM Manipulation to toggle the responsive navbar menu to slide down from atop the page. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned how to solidify my grid and flex positioning as well as how to shift my responsive navigation menu.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practice to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here - including DOM Manipulation.
I will also further my understanding of using the root element and some flex concepts.


### Useful resources
